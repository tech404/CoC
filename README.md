# tech404 Code of Conduct

All participants in this Slack community are required to provide full names in their profile and agree with the following code of conduct. Administrators will enforce this code.

# The Quick Version

atldevs is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of Slack participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any chat topic. Participants violating these rules will be expelled from the group at the sole discretion of the group administrators.

# The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please notify a Slack administrator immediately, or email atldevs@forty9ten.com
We expect participants to follow these rules in all discussions in our Slack channels. We think people should follow these rules outside of Slack too!
