# tech256 Code of Conduct

All participants in the tech256 chat are expected to follow the code of
conduct. Administrators will enforce this code.

User accounts shall not be shared and shall represent individuals as
themselves.

# The Quick Version

tech256 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, religion, or political preference. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any
form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any chat topic.
Participants violating these rules will be expelled from the group at the sole
discretion of the group administrators.

# The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions or other
events, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

Group notifications (such as `@channel` and `@here`) may only be used by admins and channel "owners".
An "owner" is an individual responsible in some way for the organization of the channel.
For e.g. @jackbower might @channel #ctu of an attempt on @davidpalmer's life.
Enforcement of this is at the pure disgression of the admins.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, have a problem with notifications, or have
any other concerns, please notify an administrator immediately, or email
<report@tech256.com>.
